[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/joabakk/signalk-vesselsetup-plugin.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
An experimental plugin to configure static vessel info, and a rate of submitting to the tree

The first object saves to the <vessel>.json file, and the rest looks for schema items that are not populated in the tree, and can set static values.
